        In these prototypes, we explored potential additional directions for the ClimateTrace dataset. These prototypes were intended to  take small but meaningful steps towards additional functionality or modes of examination for such a large, intricate, and important dataset.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, wherever possible, we are creating templates and open-source tools so that anyone can pick up this data and modify it for their own analysis.

        What would the impact of removing or replacing a given asset be? How would that impact emissions?</p>
        
        <p>How would that impact the climate? This tools attempts to answer these questions by allowing users to select assets and see the impact of removing them. This could be useful for researchers, policymakers, and journalists who want to compare different groupings of assets or scenarios on global emissions.

        As these prototypes were created, we noticed some areas where developer experience could be improved or additional data could be provided from the core API.</p>
